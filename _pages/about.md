Hi! I am Ritam Pal. I am a Ph.D. Student at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune, working under the supervision of Prof. M. S. Santhanam. My research is supported by Prime Minister's Research Fellowship. I am interested in questions of practical relevance in the broad area of complex systems.  Complex systems aremade up of many components which interact with each other nonlinearly and give rise to emergent behaviours.Networks provide a useful framework to model these systems. During literature review, opinion dynamics on social networks and higher order models of networks caught my interest. My future work will be the study of critical transition in multiplex network, which I hope to be computationally extensive and data driven.
